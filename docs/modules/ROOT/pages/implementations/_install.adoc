== Installing micrometer-registry-{system}

It is recommended to use the BOM provided by Micrometer (or your framework if any), you can see how to configure it xref:../installing.adoc[here]. The examples below assume you are using a BOM.

=== Gradle

After the BOM is xref:../installing.adoc[configured], add the following dependency:

[source,groovy,subs=+attributes]
----
implementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-{system}'
----

NOTE: The version is not needed for this dependency since it is defined by the BOM.

=== Maven

After the BOM is xref:../installing.adoc[configured], add the following dependency:

[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
  <artifactId>micrometer-registry-{system}</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: The version is not needed for this dependency since it is defined by the BOM.
